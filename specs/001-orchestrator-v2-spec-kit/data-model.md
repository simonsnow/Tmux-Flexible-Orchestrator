# Data Model: Spec Kit Artifacts for Orchestrator v2

## Artifact Overview
- **Spec Artifact** (`spec.md`)
  - Captures user scenarios, acceptance criteria, and functional requirements for orchestrator enhancements.
  - Structured according to `spec-kit/templates/spec-template.md`.
- **Plan Artifact** (`plan.md`)
  - Details execution phases, technical context, constitution checks, and risk mitigations.
  - Follows `spec-kit/templates/plan-template.md` with project-specific adjustments for CLI tooling.
- **Tasks Artifact** (`tasks.md`)
  - Enumerates sequenced tasks (T001, T002, â€¦) covering setup, verification, implementation, and polish.
  - Derived from `spec-kit/templates/tasks-template.md`, tailored to documentation and workflow updates.

## Relationships
- `plan.md` references `spec.md` as its authoritative source (`Input` section).
- `tasks.md` references both `plan.md` and supporting documents (this file, `research.md`) to validate coverage.
- Verification checklist (to be created) consumes `tasks.md` outputs to assert artifact freshness.

## Future Extensions
- Additional research documents (e.g., `quickstart.md`, `contracts/`) can define more granular instructions for agent communication and automation.
- When automating template copying, store script outputs under `contracts/` to share expected JSON payloads with agents.
