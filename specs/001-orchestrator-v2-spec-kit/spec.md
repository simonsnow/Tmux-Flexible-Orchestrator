# Feature Specification: Tmux Orchestrator v2 - Spec Kit Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-orchestrator-v2-spec-kit`
**Created**: 2025-09-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create the v2 release of the Tmux Orchestrator that integrates the spec-kit submodule so specifications, plans, and task flows are generated through Spec-Driven Development."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A power user launches the orchestrator, activates the new v2 workflow, and is guided through producing a feature specification, implementation plan, and task list using Spec Kit templates before assigning work to subordinate ChatGPT agents.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the orchestrator is running in a tmux session, **When** the user issues the "start project" command for v2, **Then** the orchestrator produces a Spec Kit specification file seeded with the project description and links the follow-up plan/tasks steps.
2. **Given** a project manager ChatGPT agent receives the orchestrator briefing, **When** it inspects the workspace, **Then** it finds clear instructions and artifacts directing it to execute Spec Kit-driven `/specify`, `/plan`, and `/tasks` flows before writing any code.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when Spec Kit assets cannot be downloaded from GitHub? ‚Üí The workflow must fall back to the vendored submodule templates and communicate the offline requirement.
- How does system handle existing specs from earlier versions? ‚Üí The workflow must avoid overwriting prior `specs/*` directories and surface choices for users to continue or archive legacy specs.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: The orchestrator MUST expose a documented procedure for initializing new specs using the local spec-kit templates when network access is unavailable.
- **FR-002**: ChatGPT agents MUST receive updated role instructions that enforce completing spec-kit `/specify`, `/plan`, and `/tasks` phases before implementation begins.
- **FR-003**: The project MUST include an end-to-end example ("v2 test project") demonstrating the Spec Kit workflow, including generated spec, plan, and task artifacts stored under `specs/`.
- **FR-004**: The orchestrator MUST surface a verification checklist so users can confirm Spec Kit artifacts exist and are current before agents continue coding.
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST clarify how to escalate or recover when Spec Kit scripts detect missing prerequisites (e.g., git branch conflicts, required CLI tools).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Spec Artifact Directory**: Each feature stores Spec Kit outputs under `specs/<feature-branch>/` containing `spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and supporting research files.
- **Agent Instruction Set**: Updated knowledge base entries guiding orchestrator, project manager, and developer agents on Spec Kit-first workflows.
- **Verification Checklist**: List of validation steps (script or manual) confirming spec, plan, and tasks exist and match requested feature.
