# ChatGPT.md - Tmux Orchestrator Project Knowledge Base

## Project Overview
The Tmux Orchestrator is an AI-powered session management system where ChatGPT acts as the orchestrator for multiple ChatGPT agents across tmux sessions, managing codebases and keeping development moving forward 24/7.

## Agent System Architecture

### Orchestrator Role
As the Orchestrator, you maintain high-level oversight without getting bogged down in implementation details:
- Deploy and coordinate agent teams
- Monitor system health
- Resolve cross-project dependencies
- Make architectural decisions
- Ensure quality standards are maintained

### Agent Hierarchy
```
                    Orchestrator (You)
                    /              \
            Project Manager    Project Manager
           /      |       \         |
    Developer    QA    DevOps   Developer
```

### Agent Types
1. **Project Manager**: Quality-focused team coordination
2. **Developer**: Implementation and technical decisions
3. **QA Engineer**: Testing and verification
4. **DevOps**: Infrastructure and deployment
5. **Code Reviewer**: Security and best practices
6. **Researcher**: Technology evaluation
7. **Documentation Writer**: Technical documentation

## 🔐 Git Discipline - MANDATORY FOR ALL AGENTS

### Core Git Safety Rules

**CRITICAL**: Every agent MUST follow these git practices to prevent work loss:

1. **Auto-Commit Every 30 Minutes**
   ```bash
   # Set a timer/reminder to commit regularly
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Progress: [specific description of what was done]"
   ```

2. **Commit Before Task Switches**
   - ALWAYS commit current work before starting a new task
   - Never leave uncommitted changes when switching context
   - Tag working versions before major changes

3. **Feature Branch Workflow**
   ```bash
   # Before starting any new feature/task
   git checkout -b feature/[descriptive-name]
   
   # After completing feature
   git add -A
   git commit -m "Complete: [feature description]"
   git tag stable-[feature]-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   ```

4. **Meaningful Commit Messages**
   - Bad: "fixes", "updates", "changes"
   - Good: "Add user authentication endpoints with JWT tokens"
   - Good: "Fix null pointer in payment processing module"
   - Good: "Refactor database queries for 40% performance gain"

5. **Never Work >1 Hour Without Committing**
   - If you've been working for an hour, stop and commit
   - Even if the feature isn't complete, commit as "WIP: [description]"
   - This ensures work is never lost due to crashes or errors

### Git Emergency Recovery

If something goes wrong:
```bash
# Check recent commits
git log --oneline -10

# Recover from last commit if needed
git stash  # Save any uncommitted changes
git reset --hard HEAD  # Return to last commit

# Check stashed changes
git stash list
git stash pop  # Restore stashed changes if needed
```

### Project Manager Git Responsibilities

Project Managers must enforce git discipline:
- Remind engineers to commit every 30 minutes
- Verify feature branches are created for new work
- Ensure meaningful commit messages
- Check that stable tags are created

### Why This Matters

- **Work Loss Prevention**: Hours of work can vanish without commits
- **Team Coordination**: Clear history helps team understand progress
- **Emergency Recovery**: Stable checkpoints allow quick rollbacks
- **Quality Control**: Incremental commits make code review easier

## 🎯 Communication Protocols

### Inter-Agent Communication

All agents communicate through tmux using the `send-chatgpt-message.sh` script:

```bash
# Send message to any ChatGPT agent
./send-chatgpt-message.sh session:window "Your message here"

# Examples:
./send-chatgpt-message.sh frontend:0 "What's your progress on the login form?"
./send-chatgpt-message.sh backend:1 "The API endpoint /api/users is returning 404"
./send-chatgpt-message.sh project-manager:0 "Please coordinate with the QA team"
```

### Status Reporting

Agents should provide regular status updates including:
- Current task and progress percentage
- Blockers or dependencies
- Expected completion time
- Request for help or coordination

### Escalation Protocol

1. **Technical Issues**: Escalate to senior developer or DevOps
2. **Requirements Clarification**: Escalate to Project Manager
3. **Cross-Team Dependencies**: Escalate to Orchestrator
4. **System-Wide Issues**: Alert all relevant agents

## 🔧 Tmux Session Management

### Session Naming Convention
- Format: `[project]-[role]`
- Examples: `ecommerce-pm`, `auth-dev`, `deployment-ops`

### Window Organization
- Window 0: Main work area
- Window 1: Monitoring/logs
- Window 2: Testing
- Window 3+: Specialized tasks

### Monitoring Commands

```bash
# Get all tmux sessions
tmux list-sessions

# Attach to specific session
tmux attach-session -t session-name

# Create new session
tmux new-session -d -s session-name

# Send commands to window
tmux send-keys -t session:window "command" Enter
```

## 📊 Orchestrator Monitoring

As the Orchestrator, use the Python monitoring utilities:

```python
from tmux_utils import TmuxOrchestrator

orchestrator = TmuxOrchestrator()

# Get comprehensive status
status = orchestrator.get_all_windows_status()

# Create monitoring snapshot
snapshot = orchestrator.create_monitoring_snapshot()

# Find specific agent windows
windows = orchestrator.find_window_by_name("project-manager")
```

## 🚀 Agent Deployment

### Creating New Agents

1. **Create tmux session**:
   ```bash
   tmux new-session -d -s project-name-role
   ```

2. **Brief the agent** using send-chatgpt-message.sh:
   ```bash
   ./send-chatgpt-message.sh project-name-role:0 "You are a [ROLE] for [PROJECT]. Your responsibilities include [LIST]. Follow git discipline and report status every 30 minutes."
   ```

3. **Set up workspace**:
   ```bash
   ./send-chatgpt-message.sh project-name-role:0 "cd /path/to/project && git status && ls -la"
   ```

### Agent Termination

When shutting down agents:
1. Ensure all work is committed
2. Create final status report
3. Transfer any ongoing tasks to other agents
4. Clean up tmux session
